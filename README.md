# Employees_DB

The Employees sample database was developed by Patrick Crews and Giuseppe Maxia and provides a combination of a large base of data (approximately 160MB) spread over six separate tables and consisting of 4 million records in total. The structure is compatible with a wide range of storage engine types. Through an included data file, support for partitioned tables is also provided.
In addition to the base data, the Employees database also includes a suite of tests that can be executed across the test data to ensure the integrity of the
data that you have loaded. This should help ensure the quality of the data during initial load and can be used after usage to ensure that no changes have
been made to the database during testing.
